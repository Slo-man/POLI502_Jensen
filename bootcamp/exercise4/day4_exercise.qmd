# Clean up your workspace 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)) # remove all the named objects visible in the environment 
cat("\014") # clean your console
```

## 1. Let's do more exercises with dplyr (with a different dataset) 

Please download the nycflights13 data by installing this package called `nycflights13`

```{r}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library("nycflights13")
head(flights)
```

### 1-1: Please find all March flights in the data (the dataset is named "flights") flights


```{r}
march_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(month==3)
march_flights
```

### 1-2 :Create a new variable as date with a format like this 1/1/2013, using the `mutate()` function

```{r}
flights %>% select(1:3) %>% mutate(date = paste(month, day, year, sep="/"))
```


### 1-3: Change column name tailnum to tail_number

```{r}
flights %>% rename (tail_number = tailnum) %>% select(tail_number)
```


### 1-4: Group flights by their origins

```{r}
flights %>% group_by(origin)
```


### 1-5: Count how many flights departing from JFK on 2013-12-31?


```{r}
flights %>% filter(origin == "JFK" & year == 2013 & month == 12 & day == 31) %>% nrow()
```

### 1-6: Calculate the average hours of delay in departure for all flights from JFK

```{r}
flights %>% group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(delay_avg = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T))
```
